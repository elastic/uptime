**Summary of the problem** (If there are multiple problems or use cases, prioritize them)
For example: as I user I want to see if one of my sites is down. Which one is down? Since when is it down?

**Ideal solution** (optional)
For example: the ideal solution would provide an availability summary and detailed status information of my site.

**List known (technical) restrictions and requirements**
For example: has to be scalable from 0-15k containers

**Are there any pages or actions that relate to this feature?**
For example: link to other solutions for further investigation
