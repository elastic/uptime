**Summary of the problem** (If there are multiple problems or use cases, prioritize them)
For example: as I user I want to quickly identify if one of my sites is down

**User stories**
For example: as an admin, I can create teams and invite new members

**List known (technical) restrictions and requirements**
For example: has to be scalable from 0-15k containers

If in doubt, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the `#observability-design` Slack channel.
